Diagnosis

The combined build step ("vite build && esbuild server/index.ts ...") returned a non‑zero exit code (2) — the esbuild step (server/index.ts) failed. See the command in line 72 and the final failure in line 76.
Most likely causes:
server/index.ts is missing or not committed to the repo (esbuild cannot open the entry file).
server/index.ts imports or requires packages that esbuild cannot resolve or that are being treated as external (the command uses --packages=external), and those packages are not available/installed at build time or not referenced properly in package.json.
Or esbuild is encountering a syntax/TS error in server/index.ts or an unresolved path import during bundling.
What to check right now (quick verification)

Confirm the server entry exists in the repo: https://github.com/KeshavK2089/PropertyConnect/blob/main/server/index.ts
Confirm server dependencies are declared in package.json (so externalizing them will make sense): https://github.com/KeshavK2089/PropertyConnect/blob/main/package.json
Reproduce locally to see the full esbuild error: run npm run build (the same script Netlify runs) and inspect the detailed error output.
Specific fixes (pick the one that matches what you find)

A) If server/index.ts is missing or not committed

Add/commit the file to the repo (git add server/index.ts; git commit; git push). Netlify cannot bundle a file that is not in the repository.
B) If esbuild reports "Could not resolve" or similar for packages you intended to bundle or treat as external

First verify the package is listed in package.json or the file you intend to externalize is committed. If not, add it to package.json (npm install <pkg> --save) and commit package.json and package-lock.json.
If you intentionally want esbuild to treat some packages as external at bundle time, keep --packages=external. If you want esbuild to bundle them instead, remove that flag from your build script. Example: edit package.json script from (current) to:
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist"
  }
}
Alternatively, if the problem is Vite/rollup externalization, add the package(s) to rollupOptions.external in vite.config.ts after verifying packages are present in package.json. Example:
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      external: ['express'] // verify 'express' is in package.json before adding here
    }
  }
});
C) If esbuild fails due to a TypeScript/syntax error or unresolved relative import

Run npm run build locally to see the detailed stack trace, fix the TypeScript/syntax error or correct the import path (case-sensitive path issues are common on Linux/Netlify).
Ensure tsconfig.json is correct and that files are included in compilation.
D) Debugging and logging

Temporarily make the esbuild command verbose so you can see the true failure on Netlify. For example in package.json:
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist --log-level=debug"
  }
}
Then push and watch the Netlify logs for the precise error.

If you see Node version related messages, change Node on Netlify by following Netlify’s doc: https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript

Summary action list

Verify server/index.ts exists and is committed: https://github.com/KeshavK2089/PropertyConnect/blob/main/server/index.ts
Verify packages used by server/index.ts are in package.json: https://github.com/KeshavK2089/PropertyConnect/blob/main/package.json
Reproduce locally (npm run build) to see exact esbuild message and then either:
commit the missing files, or
remove --packages=external to bundle dependencies, or
add the missing packages to package.json and/or to rollupOptions.external (but only after verifying they exist in package.json).
